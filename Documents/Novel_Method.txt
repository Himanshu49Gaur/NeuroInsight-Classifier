Integrated Novel Method: Multi-source Transfer Learning with Feature Alignment and Survival Analysis for Sepsis Early Detection

Overview:
This method proposes a multi-source transfer learning (MSTL) framework combined with feature alignment (FATL), semi-supervised optimal transport (SPSSOT), and survival analysis to improve early sepsis prediction. It leverages the strengths of the methods used in the base paper, along with the methodologies explored in the other papers, to create a robust, adaptable, and generalizable system. The system will predict sepsis risk, estimate the time-to-sepsis onset, and identify critical features for diverse patient populations (e.g., elderly, ICU, or neonates).
