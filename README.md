## 1. **Introduction**
- Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and a leading cause of dementia globally, gradually affecting memory, cognitive thinking, and behavioral abilities.
- Early diagnosis is crucial in slowing the progression of cognitive deterioration and supporting timely patient treatment planning.
- Traditional radiology-based diagnosis relies heavily on expert radiologists manually analyzing MRI scans, which can be time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone.
- This project presents an **AI-powered deep learning approach** using MRI brain scan classification to automate Alzheimer diagnosis, enabling faster and more accurate support for medical professionals.

## 2. **Problem Statement**
- Manual MRI analysis struggles with consistency and scalability due to the increasing number of dementia patients.
- Misinterpretation or delayed diagnosis leads to late treatment initiation, reducing patient recovery quality.
- Medical centers face radiologist shortages and require automated systems for evaluation.
- Therefore, there is a need for a **reliable, automated classification system** capable of detecting Alzheimer’s disease progression accurately and efficiently.
