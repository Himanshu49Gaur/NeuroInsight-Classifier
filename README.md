## 1. **Introduction**
- Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and a leading cause of dementia globally, gradually affecting memory, cognitive thinking, and behavioral abilities.
- Early diagnosis is crucial in slowing the progression of cognitive deterioration and supporting timely patient treatment planning.
- Traditional radiology-based diagnosis relies heavily on expert radiologists manually analyzing MRI scans, which can be time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone.
- This project presents an **AI-powered deep learning approach** using MRI brain scan classification to automate Alzheimer diagnosis, enabling faster and more accurate support for medical professionals.
